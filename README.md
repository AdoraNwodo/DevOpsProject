# SampleLibraryApp
The SampleLibraryApp is a simple REST API for managing a library of books. It allows you to view all books in the library, view details of a specific book, add a new book to the library, mark a book as borrowed, and mark a book as returned.

There are two projects. One is written in ASP.NET Core 3.1 while the other is written in NodeJS.

## Getting Started
### ASP.NET
To get started with the Library API, you'll need to have Visual Studio 2019 installed. Once you've got Visual Studio installed, follow these steps:

- Clone this repository to your local machine using Git or download the ZIP file and extract it.
- Open the solution file `(dotnet.sln)` in the `/dotnet` directory in Visual Studio.
- Build the solution to download any missing dependencies.
- Run the project (F5 or Ctrl + F5).
- The API should now be running at `http://localhost:portnumber`.

### NodeJS
To get started with the Sample Library App, follow these steps:

- Clone this repository to your local machine using Git or download the ZIP file and extract it.
- Install Node.js v14.16.1 or higher from the official website.
- Open a terminal in the project directory `(/nodejs)` and run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
- Run `npm start` to start the application in development mode.
- The application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.
